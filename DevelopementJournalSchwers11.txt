This week on Study Buddy I made a few appearance changes. I made all the fonts a little bigger and changed the background color to a nice baby blue. Also Me and Bo did more research on the switch and he's getting very close to solving it. Once He's done with that then we can Finally implement and perfect our EOC calculator. Next week I am going to make a new page that contains study habits and tips. Also I am going to add something else to the homepage, I'm not exactly sure what but I'll figure it out. Maybe a Picture or something.

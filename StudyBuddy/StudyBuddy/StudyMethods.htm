        <h2>Study Buddy Tips and Methods</h2>
        <p id = "container"> Here are some Study Buddy proven study methods and tips! We here at Study Buddy have collected a database of the best and most time tested study tips and methods! Please read and use these methods!</p>
           <h3>Make a List!</h3>
    <p> Set aside hours each day for studying. Make a schedule that includes how much and how long you should study for each class. Make sure to include breaks! And don't make your study sessions too long! Remember quality over quantity. Also schedule your bed time so that you get atleast 8 hours! Sleep is very important for healthy brain function!</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Find a Good Place</h3>
   <p>If you have a hard time concentrating, your surroundings might be your problem! Find a place that's comfortable and quiet. Put your phone down and in another room so it's not distracting you. Find a place and consistently study there. Your brain will associate that place with studying and that will allow you to concentrate better.</p>
   <br>
   <h3> Use Study Tools!</h3>
   <p> Flash cards aren't just for 3rd graders! They can be a very effective way to learn and memorize material! If you carry them around with you and take them out whenever you're wasting time they can be very useful!</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Reviewing Material Frequently</h3>
   <p>A student who does not review material can forget 80% of what has been learned in only two weeks! The first review should come  shortly after the material was first learned. Reviewing early acts as a safeguard against forgetting and helps you remember far longer. Frequent reviews throughout the course will bring rewards at test time and will alleviate pre-test anxiety.</p>

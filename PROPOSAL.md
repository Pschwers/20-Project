# Proposal: EOC calculator 
## Make a profile and see what you need on your Finals to get or keep a good grade Parker Schwers and Bo Romans  
## Needs and Opportunities Many students struggle with finals week, and there is a lack of school help at one convenient location. This is why we are going to create the directory for school.  
## Audience / Clients / Users We are going to have students be the clientbase. Parents may use this, however it is still for the student. We will have plenty of access to students and at almost any point in time we could ask them about how to improve the website. We ourselves are students, too. This means we know what to look for in a website for studying.  
## Product We will have a completed website that allows for students to input what their current grades are and how much the EOC is valued at. The website will then output what they need to get on the EOC to achieve a certain grade, and some websites for studying to help with EOC’s that will need studying.  

## Timeline  | Date          | Deliverable   | | ------------- | ------------- | | February 26   | Website Made| | April 1       | Basic Methods implemented | | April 29      | Profile database made|  
## Reality Check We will only need a server to store the profiles, and a Website Host to create a domain. The Web host could cost some money but because we probably won’t have very much traffic it will be very cheap. However, Mr. Schreiber has offered to provide a host server so the cost for us should be zero.  
## Conclusion We want to make studying as easy as inputting a few values into a site. This will be a huge help to students everywhere, and especially when there is a lack of motivation for studying. We also provide the sites for studying whatever class you need to, so preparing for the EOC will be easier than ever.

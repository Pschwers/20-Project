This week me and Bo decided on what IDE we are going to use for our project. We decided on Cloud 9, Cloud 9 uses the cloud for storage so me and Bo can both work on it at the same time. We set up our accounts and created a workspace that we both share. We also laid out a few more ideas for our Finals calculator, like suggesting sites that can help you study if you need to get a good grade on the final to bring up or keep your grade. Also, creating seperate tabs for each of the different classes the user is taking. I also fixed my repoisitory, well actually Mr. Schreiber did but I learned how to fix it.  I also downloaded Sublime text for writing code and developement journals. My goal is to start programming the HTML and doing research on how to create a database for users.

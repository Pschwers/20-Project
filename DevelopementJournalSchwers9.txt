This week Bo and I Finally finished putting all the classes in and we wroked more on the switch. It has been very difficult. I've googled many things trying to figure out what exactly the problem is but I haven't solved it quite yet. My goal for next week is to figure it out. Also I want to add more artistic touches to the website using Cascading Style Sheets. Maybe add some more creative borders or a developers web page with pictures of me and Bo. I could also make a cooler background using software. We'll see.

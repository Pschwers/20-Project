# 20-Project
My 20% project
This week Herr Schreiber helped Bo and I move all of our stuff from our computers to cloud 9 where we do all our coding. This will make uploading everything through the terminal much easier. I really appreciate the help he provided. He is definetely my favorite teacher. I'm really excited for the child that he is bringing into the world. He will be a great father and Edmund is an awesome name, not quite as awesome as Parker but close. Anywho this week I also worked more on the website adding trying to figure out the switch and did a lot of research on how to do it. Also I added some cosmetic changes.

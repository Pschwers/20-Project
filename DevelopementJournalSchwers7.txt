This week me and Bo started finding websites to link to study from. We have a lot of classes our users are going to be able to choose from. Most falls under the subjects of English (Core, electives, Remediation, Honors/AP), Math (Core, Electives, AP), Science(Core, Comprehensive, Electives, AP), History and Social Sciences(Core, Comprehensive, AP), World Languages(comprehensive), ELectives, Computer Sciences. We think that this will be a broad enough range of classes to cover most everyones needs. We will recommend these websites to our clients depending on there classes. Next week I'm plaaning on completing all the websites then implementing them into the website itself. Also figuring out how to create the class selection and the calaculations to figure out the grades our users need to get on their finals.
